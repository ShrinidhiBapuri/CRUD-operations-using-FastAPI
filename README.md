This project provides a simple API to manage users with CRUD operations using FastAPI, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete user data efficiently. The API includes user data fields such as id, name, phone_no, and address, with built-in validation using Pydantic. It features an in-memory database implementation and interactive API documentation through Swagger UI (/docs). The technology stack includes FastAPI for API development, Pydantic for validation, Swagger UI for endpoint testing, and Postman for manual testing. The application supports key CRUD operations, including creating (POST /users/), reading (GET /users/{id}), updating (PUT /users/{id}), and deleting (DELETE /users/{id}). To run the project, clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn. The API documentation is available via Swagger UI and Redoc. Future enhancements include database integration, authentication, unit testing, and improved error handling. FastAPIâ€™s efficiency and automatic validation make it an excellent choice for developing scalable RESTful APIs. This project serves as a foundation for further development and customization.
